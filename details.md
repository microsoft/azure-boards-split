# Split! 

Split! enables teams to easily continue unfinished work items into the next sprint by “splitting” the work item into a new card in the next sprint.

### What's special about Split?
Smart detects incomplete tasks - even for processes with custom states
Defaults split work item to the next iteration
Maintains parent link
Retains all attachments
Copies description, repro steps, acceptance criteria and any required fields to new work item
Inserts comment revision with links detailing the split operation
Optionally copies all tags

## How does it work? 
Use the context menu of a work item from the board or backlog to **Split** a work item with unfinished work into the next sprint.

![Invoke Split from work item context menu](/img/split-contextmenu.png "Context Menu")

The dialog automatically populates with the remaining incomplete items.
Update/keep the title, review and remove any items that no longer meet the requirements, and click **Split**.

![Select the remaining work items tobe split](/img/split-dialog.png "Dialog")

The new split work item is created in the next sprint with the remaining work items.
